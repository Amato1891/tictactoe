<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe:</h1> This is a tic-tac-toe project from the React section of my course. 
<h1>Description:</h1> The old time game of tic-tac-toe that can be played with 2 players alternating turns. The first one to get 3 symbols in a row wins, if no winner is found after 9 turns then its a cats game!
<h1>Future Improvements:</h1> This is a very vanilla project and I will be adding several features in the future. The first feature will be a New Game button that clears the board and re-renders a fresh game. Another bit of functionality I would like to add is a drop down box where you can change the color scheme of the board to fit your liking.
